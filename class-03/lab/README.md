# Lab: Cyber Risk Analysis

## Overview

Cybersecurity risk analysis is vital in your efforts to identify, protect, and manage all your client's information data, systems, and resources. Risk analysis allows you to ultimately create a suitable plan to secure and manage risks for the organization.

## Scenario

A third party has recently performed a cyber hygiene assessment for Initrobe. The CTO has requested you compose a risk assessment report as part of the company's strategic planning efforts.

The CTO also asked you "What if the cloud data center gets flooded? We've heard that the proposed region we'll be using is located in a physical area susceptible to floods."

The data center is valued at 6,173,160.00 USD. If a flooding happens 15-30% of the data center is estimated to be compromised. The flooding tends to happen every four to six years.

## Objectives

- Create a risk assessment report for Initrobe.
- Perform a quantitative deterministic risk analysis against the data center scenario.

## Resources

## Tasks

### Part 1: Review the CyHy Report

- Read through the CyHy Report and identify potential risks
  - Take notes as needed

### Part 2: Create the Risk Assessment Report

- Using the provided Excel worksheet, populate the fields and submit the completed worksheet.
- What are the biggest cyber risks to Initrobe? 
  - Justify your reasoning.
  - For each risk, what are at least two ways we could mitigate the risk?
  - For each risk, what is the most effective risk mitigation technique of the ideas you came up with? This should be the lowest cost and greatest mitigation.

### Part 3: Quantitative Deterministic Risk Calculation

- For the **worst** case scenario:
  - Determine the AV, EF, and ARO. Justify your reasoning.
  - Calculate the SLE. Explain and justify your method.
  - Calculate the ALE. Explain and justify your method.
- For the **best** case scenario:
  - Determine the AV, EF, and ARO. Justify your reasoning.
  - Calculate the SLE. Explain and justify your method.
  - Calculate the ALE. Explain and justify your method.
- For the **most likely** scenario:
  - Determine the AV, EF, and ARO. Justify your reasoning.
  - Calculate the SLE. Explain and justify your method.
  - Calculate the ALE. Explain and justify your method.
- Create a table in your Google Doc submission of the calculated values for all three scenarios. Convert and present the monetary figures in USD for all fields of the table, and include the conversion rate used.

## Stretch Goal (Optional Objectives)

- Generate useful graphs/visuals of your findings for:
  - Part 2: Risks
  - Part 3: Scenarios compared
