# Lab: Cloud Security Principles and Frameworks

## Overview

We are in the midst of a digital transformation towards cloud infrastructure, as businesses rethink the way they deliver their core services. It is essential to explore cloud-specific security concepts such as the shared responsibility model, as well as how to determine whether a cloud system meets specific compliance requirements.

## Scenario

As part of its strategic growth initiative, Initrobe wants to adopt a SOC2-compliant cloud IaaS provider to host critical company data and resources, including such documents as HR and financial records. The CTO is deciding between AWS, Azure, and GCP.

## Objectives

- Research AWS, GCP, and Azure to determine to what extent each are SOC2 compliant
  - Utilize the AWS Artifact Portal as part of this exercise
- Recommend an appropriate IaaS solution to the client
  - Justify your recommendation
- Compose a Cloud Security Policy

## Resources

- [AWS Artifact](https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/){:target="_blank"}
- [Azure Compliance Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/compliance/){:target="_blank"}
- [GCP Compliance Resource Center](https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/){:target="_blank"}
- [Cloud Security Policy Template PDF](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0E1ux7MCK6hvgjOO9NeSAJGYA#Cloud_security_policy_template){:target="_blank"}

## Tasks

### Part 1: Cloud Provider Research

- Research and determine the level of SOC 2 compliance of each cloud provider Initrobe is considering.
- Include your findings in your submission doc and cite your sources.

### Part 2: Provider Recommendation

Which IaaS provider should Initrobe adopt for its needs? Explain:
- How is this provider SOC 2 compliant?
- Will Initrobe be able to store HR (PII) data on this platform? Explain.
- Will initrobe be able to store financial (SOX) data on this platform? Explain.

### Part 3: Cloud Security Policy

Referencing the scenario from Lab: Class 1 as well as the provided Cloud Security Policy Template PDF, compose and submit a cloud security policy document for Initrobe.
